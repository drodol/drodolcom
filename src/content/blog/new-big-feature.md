So I am ready (and somewhat overwhelmed) to tackle my next challenge for [jobsinenglish.dk.](https://jobinenglish.dk)

Here’s what I want to do:

Currently, [jobsinenglish.dk](http://jobsinenglish.dk/) users can subscribe to the e-mail newsletter.

While this is fine, as a user of a job board, is to receive relevant job alerts for jobs that match my search criteria.

So I want to build that and make it possible for my users to not only be able to create Job Alerts, but also to decide the frequency of those alerts, be it daily or weekly.

They should also have the possibility to “manage their alerts” by accessing a simple dashboard to modify, or remove previously set alerts.

I don’t know this feels like a huge and complex endevour, but I am up for the challenge. I will document my progress (and process) to build this out.
