I jumped on the opportunity to grab this keyboard when I saw Amazon was having a sale on it and it had a 45% off discount.

Because I have Amazon Prime for free with my internet and mobile phone line provider, the keyboard arrived one day after I ordered.

**This is day 1.5**

I use a Windows laptop (HP) as my work computer. I failed to pair it via bluetooth. The keyboard simply doesn't show up, so I had to use the 2.4Ghz dongle.

I hadn't figured how to pair it with my M1 Macbook Air, so after some googing I figured it out.

Right now it is connected via bluetooth to my macbook and via the 2.4 dongle to my Windows laptop.

Device switching takes a few seconds.

In comparison with my logitech MX keys, where switching from Mac to Windows was instantaneous, but from Win to Mac, took a few seconds.

I fell that with the Epomaker, I have to wait longer.

Random disconnection happened just now from my Macbook. I was watching a Youtube video (wearing my Airpods Pro) and suddenly noticed the audio started being distorted and the keyboard had simply disconnected and was looking for signal or something.

I tried connecting via the Fn+Q shortcut I set up and connection wouldn't resume, so I plugged it in (turned it off) and continued working on my Macbook.

A few moments later I turned it on again, switched to the Win computer, and tried to switch back to wireless Mac, and it reconnected.

I read online there were people complaining about sudden connection drops, so I hope it's not an issue for me.

I will keep noting down my experience with this keyboard, because if it doesn't perform to my expectations, I will return it.

**Some good aspects of it**

I got the Sea Salt Silent switches, so they are not that clicky, which I like.

I am not in love with the looks. I think the color is hideous, but hey, 40% off.

The little screen display is cute, and having a physical knob for media control is nice.

Even though I have a numpad on this keyboard, it's still smaller than the MX keys, which I have had for years. So it will take a little getting used to, to land all the keystrokes and re-do muscle memory (also considering my MX keys is in a Danish layout, and the Epomaker is a US layout -which I prefer).
