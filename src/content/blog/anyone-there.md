I've been wanting to have a simple blogging setup where I have a fleeting thought I can write down using markdown and then easily publish it without thinking too much about it.

This is my first test trying to achieve that.

I'm using [Astro](https://astro.build/) which is a framework for building static sites and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which is a simple way to write formatted text.

I'd like to set this up so that I can write in Obsidian and automatically have it published (if I choose to do so) in this blog.
