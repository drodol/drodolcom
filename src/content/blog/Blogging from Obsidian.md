So I am going to give this a try now.

Blogging directly from Obsidian in my Macbook, to my live blog on the internets.

I'm still not happy with the styling, but it's getting close to something I like.

The spacing between lines feels little bit off. While I like the headings font I chose, I don't really like the body font.

Little by little, I will be tweaking this.

If all fails, I will self-host Ghost with my Coolify instance and create a similar-looking theme myself.
