If you haven't ever painted a wall, doing the best you can will look like a really bad paint job."

Your newly painted wall will suck a lot.

The good thing is that the more you paint, the better you will get at it. In the long run, you will be able to do a good job.

But the question is, who cares if we suck at something?

Everybody is so engulfed by their own self, no one is really looking or paying any attention to us.

So I say, go for it. Do the best you can and find out. Iterate, improve.

Eventually, you'll do a good job.
