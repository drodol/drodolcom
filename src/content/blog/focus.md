It's been a while since I have written here.

It's been a while since I have written, at all. Even for myself.

I miss it.

Yesterday, I felt I was once again, ready to "be back". Today I made it happen.

I started my day with a hot shower, to fend off the coldness of the morning. It gave me a good jump start.

I tackled the most important task of the day in my day job very early on in the day, and the feeling of accomplishment was good.

Then, I opened Obsidian. It was time to journal.

Another check.

The feelings of accomplishments were coming back. Those good feelings.

I am still not there for getting back into coding, but I am getting there, and I have a feeling I will be deadly fast this time around.
