title: "What I have vs. What I want"
description: "A recent post by @jasonleow prompted me to think really deep about this.
Don’t I know have what I wanted a year ago? 5 years ago? 10, heck 15 years ago?
Why do I want other things now?"

Shouldn’t I be happy? Maybe I should stop chasing the next new thing, or the new shiny object?

There are many things to unpack here, but the TL;DR is: we are not the same people we were a year ago, 5, 10 or 15 years ago.

What we thought was good then, well, is simply not what we think is good for us now.

We value other things, we grow, we learn, and this may never end.

It sometimes takes us less time to see through the noise and unveil what truly matters to us. Sometimes it takes us longer, with multiple iterations of the “same level” (as if it was a video game), or multiple “lessons” about the same errors we make.

And because money is a big part of this for me, I will soon write about it in a really long post. My beliefs about money (past and present), the lessons I’ve learned, what I aim to achieve, and how I am approaching things.
