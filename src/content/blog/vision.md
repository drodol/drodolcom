I have been on reflection mode for a while now.

It hasn't been zen-mode, guru-like reflection time.

It has been a lot more haphazard than that.

Maybe it has even been a little bit forced.

Whatever and however it has been, I embrace it. Mostly, because of the nice "aha!" moments that I have come across.

Moments like the one about discovering that maybe the reason why I haven't stuck with "coding" or "making an internet business" or "being financially independent" (notice how I went from one, to the other, and then the ultimate goal at the end) is because I don't necessarily have **a compelling vision of the future**.

This one came from watching a video from [Ali Abdaal](https://youtu.be/nIv1J5O15To?si=lAtM_0DEkUPN5kwx):

> If you don't have a vision of the future which is significantly better than your current state, there is no reason for you to act in a way that pulls you towards that future. You first need to create this compelling vision. You need to be able to articulate it.

The video was Ali's review of the book "The Twelve Week Year", and he shared something else that struck a chord:

> You must first find a vision with which you are emotionally connected to. Without a compelling vision, you will discover there is no reason to go through the pain of change. ...You will never outpace your mental models. Vision is the first place where you engage your thinking about what is possible for you.

This is not to say that I have been wandering mindlessly.

This is to say that I think until now, my vision has been blurry, and until I can not only articulate my vision clearly but make it compelling, then my ability to materialise it will be limited.
