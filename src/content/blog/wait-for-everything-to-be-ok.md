I heard that today. It hit hard.

I guess it's because life is in constant flux. It's always moving, changing, not waiting. It's busy living, and dying.

Living is easy when all is going well. When things are going our way.

The disappointment comes when we realise that it was ephemeral. When the good fades away and gives way to hardship, unfairness, and heartache.

When that state of bliss and "perfection" gives way to entropy.

That's when it's handy to remember and accept **"this too shall pass"** works for the good, and the bad.

**This too shall pass.**

In the meantime, focus on the present, not on the past.

In the meantime, focus on what we have, not on what we lack.

In the meantime, focus on what we can control and influence, not on the impossible.

In the meantime, live life. **This too shall pass.**
