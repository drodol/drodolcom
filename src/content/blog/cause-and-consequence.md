The thing to remember here, is most times, we are immersed in complex systems, ones where the simple cause-effects models don't really apply.

In these systems, many factors can influence the outcomes, and one cannot simply use cause-consequence models and methods to analyse failures.

It is human nature to want to find easy, simple explanations to problems. But sometimes, doing so, can lead us to fix the wrong things.
