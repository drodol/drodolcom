Prompted by a tweet from @jasonleow about the fact that there are only 100 days left of 2024, I decided to try a little experiment.

Since, I have started a set of “habits” I am bundling together.

I don’t know if what I am experiencing now is some sort of artificial response to my thinking this is doing me good, or an actual good outcome of the very short time I have been at this.

I don’t think it even matters if it is one or the other, but here’s what I have been up to lately:

1.  I have removed all social media apps from my phone, except for Youtube: no Instagram, no FB, no X, no Reddit. My screentime has been **drastically** reduced.
2.  I have started reading books daily. Currently re-reading [MJ Demarco’s Millionaire Fastlane](https://a.co/d/2YqiPi8) for non-fiction (capturing my thoughts as I read also, I will posting my notes), and the [End Times Alaska](https://a.co/d/0xSfxG1) for fiction, popcorn reading as @Winkletter would put it.
3.  I have started walking daily, for at least 30 minutes, usually more. I will probably start doing some light weight lifting in a few days (I have a shoulder injury I am recovering from).
4.  I have resumed my daily writing practice.

These are some the results I have been experiencing:

1.  I feel more focused an energised.
2.  I feel peaceful.
3.  Writing allows me to quiet the “monkey brain” and get perspective. Get new ideas (I plan to build a Job Application Tracker inside [jobsinenglish.dk](http://jobsinenglish.dk/) but also launch it as a standalone app). I am also thinking about a few niche webapp solutions I can build that are related to my day job field of Health & Safety Management. Maybe partner with ex-colleagues for distribution or potential clients.
4.  I seem to be more capable of connecting dots or seeing ideas where there weren’t any before. Not sure how to explain this.
5.  The quality of my relationships has improved. I am having more interesting chats with my 14-y.o., as an example.

I am really looking forward to what the next weeks look like!
