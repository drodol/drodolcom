I have been writing at least 100 words -for myself- everyday since January 1st, 2025. While I'd like to publish all my writings, I feel some of it is either not interesting for others to read, or simply way too personal for me to feel comfortable posting it. I have a DayOne subscription and while I really enjoy writing there, I exported all my writing from there and brought it into Obsidian, where I have been writing since the beginning of the year. This gives me the ability to keep my writing in my local machine, but also to easily publish where I choose to, or feed it to an LLM (like I did with Cursor) and ask it to identify trends or recurring themes. It was a bit eye-opening to get some brutal feedback from the LLM. See, I've always thought of myself as a risk taker. Turns out, the LLM thinks I am not (based on my writings since 2021). It's given me much to think about. Lots of reflection. Lots to unpack. Apart from writing 100 words per day, I have also been coding once a day (since January 1st), and it's been working fine. It feels good. I want to add a couple things to the list. The first: to read 1 book a month, for a total of 12 in 2025, and the last one, to form a habit of exercising, so I want to exercise at least 3x per week. I'll go easy on myself, but I think it's totally doable. I am setting the bar low, removing distractions, and being super picky about how I choose to spend my time. 2025 will be different. It'll be the year of focus.
