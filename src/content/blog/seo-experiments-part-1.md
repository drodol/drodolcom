I bought [Danny Postma’s SEO](https://www.dannypostma.com/seo-course?via=drodol) course [\[1\]](#footnote-1).

This was my plan: watch it whole, giving it my full attention. Watch it a second time, this time, taking notes and writing SMART actions to implement some of the stuff myself.

This is how it’s gone: I have watch it partially, focusing on the parts I find most interesting to me and relevant to what I have to do. I have done this once. I haven’t watched it a second time nor have I taken notes or jotted down actions.

However, using free tools, I have started doing some keyword research. Initially on things that interest me (no SEO gold there, maybe I have to play with long-tail keywords). Interesting results.

I tried to use ChatGPT to give me ideas on stuff I could explore. This is a rough example of the prompt I used:

I like \[insert stuff you are interested in here\]. I also have \[X\] years of experience in \[insert fields of expertise here\] in the \[X, Y, Z\] sectors/industries. I am doing keyword research to find out software products or solutions I could build that could leverage my likes and experience, but I would like some ideas of keywords to do research on.

I don’t know if my prompt isn’t good enough, of it’s not conveying what I am after, but the results SUCKED BIG TIME. They were quite disappointing, and well, I couldn’t use them for anything. The ones that were slightly usable, well, I could have come up with myself.

How can I improve this exploration process? What changes could I make to the prompt to come up with better keywords to explore their SEO value?
