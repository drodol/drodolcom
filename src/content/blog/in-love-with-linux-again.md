As my son needed a laptop for his school, I dusted off an "oldish" laptop I had laying around.

All I needed to do was to get a new battery for it, and then install Windows -or so I thought.

Windows 10 ran extremely slow on it. It was so laggy it was unusable.

For reference, here are the specs of the machine:

This HP laptop has an Intel 5 processor with 16GB of RAM and an SSD!

I installed Kubuntu and but after a while (and during the holidays) I decided to do a fresh Ubuntu install.

Things haven't been without trouble, I must admit.

But it's great to use such an amazing piece of software that runs on old(er) machines or that simply enables us to give new life to perfectly working hardware.

I have a 2016 Macbook that also needs a new battery, and I will most likely also install Linux on it.

I have installed Windsurf, Ruby, and RoR. I have also installed Oh My Zsh, and a few other things.

I will code with this machine in the coming days and see how it fares against my M1 Macbook Air.
