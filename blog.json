We had bought cheap tickets (35EUR) the week before but decided against after seeing the weather was stormy (winds of up to 120km\/h). It ended up being the best decision because our return flight -originally scheduled at 22:00- didn't depart until Wednesday morning.<\/p><p>Instead, we took the kids to have some indoors fun at a jumping\/climbing place. Because it was a school week, they had the entire place to themselves. They were absolutely hammered after 1 hour.<\/p><p>We \"the adults\" had late lunch\/early dinner at around 16:30. We went to a typical Andalucian restaurant in Torrejon de Ardoz called El Rincon de Rafa, and all I can say is OMG. The food was outstanding, plus they had good service. My wife and my sister had beef steaks, I had lamb chops.
